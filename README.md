# A Mini Shell

This is a mini shell inspired by the workshop [build-your-own-shell](https://github.com/tokenrove/build-your-own-shell).

There are five stages in the workshop. However, I wanna make this shell not a toy. So I decide
to write more than the five stages.

The workshop has provided a shell script and tcl script to do tests. In order to write my own
tests, I decide to use GTest to do unit tests and tcl to test the functionality of the shell.
